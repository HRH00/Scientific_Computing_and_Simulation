\chapter{Conclusion}
Throughout this report, the importance of many topics and techniques surrounding scientific computing and simulation has been highlighted, such as the Navier-stokes equation for simulating fluids or  the van Cittert-Zernike equation for calculating sky intensity for Radio Interferometry. 

The world would be without technologies which are taken for granted such as CT scanners and heart monitors if not for systems studied throughout this report.

The effectiveness of optimisations, which may seem counter-intuitive, such as loop unrolling and problem decomposition in computationally heavy problems has been emphasised. 

The application of the concepts learned throughout the report has allowed the author to implement a parallel FFT, although the system did not perform well as expected - optimisations can be applied to increase the execution time
