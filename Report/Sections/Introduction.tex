\chapter{Introduction}
The purpose of this report is to document the findings and outcomes of the lab work undertaken throughout the Scientific Computing and Simulation module.

A variety of scientific computing themes and concepts are explored. The primary goal is to learn theoretical and practical skills to allow for complex and process-intensive problems to be computed while proving a comprehensive analysis of each subject.

Algorithms critical to the modern world, such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Radical transform are explored with great detail within the report. 

Throughout the lab report, a substantial amount of source code has been produced and an explanation for each concept has been provided.

The skills gained in the lab report are then utilised to complete the 'Mini Project' later on in the report. 

The selected project is to further decrease the execution time of the FFT Java program and enhance the program's efficiency by parallelising the problem, allowing it to run concurrently on multiple threads.
